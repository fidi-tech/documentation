# FiDi Trust Score

To enhance the credibility for FiDi, FiDi uses a proprietary measure called a trust score. It measures the value of blockchain projects based on various factors. This trust score is used for evaluating whether a cryptocurrency is a scam token. If the token did not pass FiDi’s proprietary trust score system, it will be automatically removed from the portfolio list. Through this feature, users will not lose funds by clicking suspicious links from the scam tokens.

FiDi also leverages the third parties’ abilities to filter out the scam tokens by default. By filtering out those assets, the possibility of getting scammed is diminished.&#x20;

Besides, users will have their customized function to tailor the portfolio they would like to show. If users find a suspicious scammed token, they can use the report features to report to the community, this will further prevent the users from losing funds.

The above measures will evolve the trust score to FiDi powered trust score that will take account more than just metrics, or just blacklist a community project. It will provide the liquidity data for a particular token, the data equation, the providers that engage in any swap or other financial services they provide. That will increase the credibility for a specific project or tokens the users invested in.

Currently, trust score is a safety measure. Overtime, the FiDi trusted score will evolve to be used in market data outside of the platform etc.&#x20;
