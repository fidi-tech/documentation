# Getting Started

### Cryptocurrency Portfolio Tracker

Users can use the portfolio tracker by simply connecting their wallet or by searching their wallet address anonymously, this gives freedom for users to decide which way they want to check their assets.



### NFT tracker

Along with cryptocurrency tracker, NFT tracker makes it a plus for FiDi. Users’ favorite collections will show up in a second once they connect their wallet or they can use the search function to search for a particular wallet’s NFT series. The NFT prices will show up simultaneously.
