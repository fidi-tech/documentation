# Privacy & Security

### Introduction

FiDi’s security is undoubtable. FiDi doesn’t write into chains or suggest transactions on your behalf, it is a thin analytics layer built on top of aggregated on-chain data and market signals with a non-custodial read-only DeFi interface. When tracking or connecting a wallet, users access the publicly available data and our blend of insights associated with the wallet address.&#x20;

### Privacy protection

FiDi protects privacy. Users can view FiDi as a high-precision analytic tool for advanced analytics synthesized from the public on-chain data. It is built on top of the public on-chain data across the decentralized finance ecosystem. The non-custodial interface surfaces analytics for any public web3 address you provide.

### Safety

FiDi carefully gathers the data that is needed for analytics. When users connect their wallet with FiDi, FiDi does not access user wallets, suggest transactions, or perform any actions on behalf of users.

FiDi acts as a window into decentralized finance, users can access advanced analytics synthesized from public on-chain data.&#x20;

### Remain anonymous

If users wish to stay anonymous, FiDi offers public wallet address tracking.&#x20;

To get started, users can first experience FiDi’s sandbox by accessing a [demo wallet ](https://app.fidi.tech/portfolio/?wallet\_id=0xb9b8ef61b7851276b0239757a039d54a23804cbb)and move on the searching journey with other whales’ wallets. Some of the wallets have been integrated into FiDi for users, like “Cuban’s wallets” and “Vitalik whales”, users can edit the stack to favor their own style.

Users can also connect wallets that are audited and recognized by the community. If users want to track their own public wallets’ addresses, this is the only part of the information that they share with FiDi temporarily.&#x20;

### Suspicious assets removing

To avoid users’ losing funds by scammers, FiDi automatically removes the suspicious assets from their portfolio that show up in public crowdsourced scam [databases](https://github.com/cryptoscamdb), are not vetted by trusted sources such as Coinbase and CoinMarketCap, or don’t pass FiDi’s proprietary trust score model.
